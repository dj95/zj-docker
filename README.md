## üöÄ Installation

Download the latest binary in the github releases. Place it somewhere, zellij is able to access it. Then the
plugin can be launched with a command or within a layout file..

You could also refer to the plugin guide from zellij, after downloading the binary: [https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-loading](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-loading)

```bash
zellij plugin -- file:./target/wasm32-wasi/debug/zj-docker.wasm
```

## üöß Development

Make sure you have rust and the `wasm32-wasi` target installed. If using nix, you could utilize the nix-shell
in this repo for obtaining `cargo` and `rustup`. Then you'll only need to add the target with
`rustup target add wasm32-wasi`.

With the toolchain, simply build `zj-docker` with `cargo build`. Then you are able to run the example configuration
with `zellij -l plugin-dev-workspace.kdl` from the root of the repository.
